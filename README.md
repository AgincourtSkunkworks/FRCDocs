# FRC Team 1246 Docs

This is a repository containing internal documentation for FRC Team 1246, published via MkDocs & GitHub Pages. While a majority of this information applies to us specifically, some information may still be useful for other teams. You are free to fork, copy, and modify any of this information for your own use.

## Contributing

We use Material for MkDocs to generate our documentation, which allows for relatively content editing and contribution. MkDocs uses Markdown (with added features) to write documentation. You'll likely already be familiar with Markdown, as a variant of it is used in GitHub and Discord.

It is recommended that you read up the necessary parts of the Material for MkDocs [documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/) and view the source code for some existing pages to gain familiarity. A page on our docs site will also be made (soon) to help you get started.
