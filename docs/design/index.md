# Design

This team focuses on the initial concept of the Robot. Through use of CAD(1), ideally, a working digital model of the Robot mechanisms will be the first priority (completed alongside build) to serve as a resource for build dimensions, the placement of electrical components, and as future reference for later seasons. Therefore, a coherent design must be decided within the 1-2 weeks of build season.
