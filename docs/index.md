# FRC Team 1246 Documentation

This website contains documentation for the FRC Team 1246, Agincourt Skunkworks. This documentation is designed for internal use, meaning some commands may reference our own repositories, and some information might be specific to us. However, a majority of this information can still be used in general, with at most a bit of modification, so we've left this public. You are free to fork, copy, and modify any of this information for your own use.

This documentation site is not meant to replace the official FIRST & WPILib documentation, but rather to supplement it with our own experiences and knowledge. While extremely common topics may be repeated here for ease of access, the official documentation should take precedence should any discrepancies arise (exceptions apply).

Should any information not be covered here, you should refer to the official documentation, contact an experienced team member (via Discord), your mentor, or any other reliable source. Once you've done that, you should consider contributing it here for future reference!
