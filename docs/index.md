# FRC Team 1246 Internal Documentation

This website contains documentation for the FRC Team 1246, Agincourt Skunkworks. Most of this documentation is designed for internal use, meaning commands will likely reference our own repositories, and some information might be specific to us. However, a majority of this information can still be used in general, with a bit of modification, so we've left this public. You are free to fork, copy, and modify any of this information for your own use.
