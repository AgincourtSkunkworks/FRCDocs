# Electrical

This team is responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the electrical systems of the robot. This includes the power distribution systems, communication systems, motors, sensors, and any other electrical components on the robot. The electrical team is also generally considered the team responsible for handling the pneumatic systems as well. The electrical team works closely with both the mechanical and software teams to ensure the seamless integration of electrical components with the robot's mechanical structure and software systems. General electrical knowledge, and skills such as soldering, and troubleshooting are of great benefit.
