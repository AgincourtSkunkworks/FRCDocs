# Control Algorithms

When it comes to interacting with the physical world, we often need to control moving components in a precise manner. This is done by using control algorithms that can be implemented in software to control the movement of motors, actuators, and other devices based on information obtained from various sensors. In FRC, the most common control algorithms are Bang Bang control, or PID control, which we cover in this section.
