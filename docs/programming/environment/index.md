This section includes documentation on how to set up various parts of your development environment, including VS Code, Git, NI, etc.

## Onboarding
The bare minimum you need to get started with programming is as follows:

- [Git & GitHub](git.md)
- [Java](java.md)
- [VS Code](vs_code.md)

## [FRC Game Tools](frc_game_tools.md) & [WPI Lib Software Package](wpilib_pkg.md)
These two tools are needed if you plan on running the code, or controlling the robot with your computer. If you don't need either of those, you will not need either of these tools.

You may also want to use the [WPI Lib Software Package](wpilib_pkg.md) if you want to install a standalone version of VS Code (WPI recommends it), or if you want to install Java & VS Code with a single installer (and don't care about software bloat).
