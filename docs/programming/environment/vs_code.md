# Installing VS Code

!!! warning

    WPI recommends **against** using a system install of VS Code (which this guide will), and recommends that you use a standalone install (via the [WPILib Package](wpilib_pkg.md)) instead.
    
    There haven't been any reported problems with using a system install however, so it is up to you. Do bear in mind that the WPI Package will install a lot of additional software that you may not need.

1. Download VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Run, and go through, the installer.

## Extensions
To install extensions:

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the extensions button on the left hand side of the window (or press ++ctrl+shift+x++)
3. Search for the extension you want (by name or ID)
4. Click the `Install` button
