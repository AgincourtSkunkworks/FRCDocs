# Installing VS Code

!!! warning

    WPI recommends **against** using a system install of VS Code (which this guide will), and recommends that you use a standalone install (via the [WPILib Package](wpilib_pkg.md)) instead.
    
    There haven't been any reported problems with using a system install however, so it is up to you. Do bear in mind that the WPI Package will install a lot of additional software that you may not need.

1. Download VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Run, and go through, the installer.

## Extensions
To install extensions:

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the extensions button on the left hand side of the window (or press ++ctrl+shift+x++)
3. Search for the extension you want
4. Click the `Install` button

---

It is recommended that you install the following extensions:

- `wpilibsuite.vscode-wpilib`
- `vscjava.vscode-java-pack`

### WPILib
It is recommended that you install the WPILib extension for VS Code, as it does a lot of stuff specific to FRC, such as generating template projects, or adding external libraries. However, if all you're doing is editing the existing code, you don't *need* it.

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the extensions button on the left hand side of the window (or press ++ctrl+shift+x++)
3. Search for `wpilibsuite.vscode-wpilib`
4. Click the `Install` button
