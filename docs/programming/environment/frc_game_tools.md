# Installing FRC Game Tools

!!! warning

    The FRC Game Tools is a fairly bloated software package.

    You only need to install the FRC Game Tools if you are planning on ***controlling***, ***configuring***, or ***imaging*** the robot with your computer.

    If you are only planning on ***programming*** the robot with your computer, you do **not** need to install the FRC Game Tools (and it is recommended that you don't).

[Official Documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html)

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or higher
    - Other operating systems are **not** supported
- A Serial Key for NI -- included with the FRC competition kit
    - The teacher advisor should have this

## Uninstalling Old Versions
It is recommended to uninstall any old versions of the FRC Game Tools each year. This can be done by going into the `Settings` app (`Apps & features`), finding `NI Software`, then clicking the `Uninstall` button. In the dialog that pops up, select all entries, then click `Remove`.

## Installation
### Installer
1. Download the [FRC Game Tools Installer](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html#479842)
2. Go through the installer normally
    - Note: It is recommended to disable Windows Fast Startup as the installer suggests
3. When you reach the `Additional items` screen, it is recommended to uncheck `NI Certificates Installer` if you care about security (it makes future installations more convenient, but less secure)
4. Go through any remaining installation screens

### Activation
Once you reach the activation screen in the installer, do the following:

1. Log in to your [ni.com](https://ni.com) account, if you don't have one, register for one
2. Enter the serial number included with the FRC competition kit

    !!! note

        If you see a `valid license not found` message, ignore it.

3. If the serial number is correct, it should say `Activation Successful`, click `Next` if so.

### Reboot
