# Build

This team is responsible for constructing the physical robot. For incoming members, this is often their first introduction to the team, as there are many entry-level tasks where they are able to develop general hand and power tool competencies. However, larger components often necessitate training on various machines in the shop, accessible to the students who are enrolled in manufacturing technology courses. Contrary to the term "Build Season", it is best to complete a functional version of the robot early on to enable the electrical, programming, and drive teams enough time to focus on their respective tasks.
