This team is responsible for the financial sustainability of the team. Members of this team connect to, and keep record of, potential sponsors within the community through emails and phone calls. Through this process, sponsor relations are developed and maintained to ensure a consistent flow of funds. While monetary donations allow for higher control over fund allocation, resources(1) are equally appreciated. Many tasks involved are entry-level and build strong communication, negotiation, organization skills, and patience that are practical on the team and in real-world situations.
